And this session will prove it.In a lot of ways, the journey HOME is about simplifying. Peeling back those parts, those habits, those layers that take away instead of give back. It‚Äôs about reuniting with the type of vibration that gives life and connection to your relationship with yourself and to the big picture.When we take time to notice we can start to pay better attention to the things that nourish.But don‚Äôt forget, ‚Äúsimplifying‚Äù and ‚Äúnourishing‚Äù don‚Äôt connote easy.We can build sustainable practices and rituals that serve. This can have a direct effect on how we carry ourselves, energetically, posturally, and in the way you hold space for yourself and for others.We will also take time to nourish parts of the body that could be a little bit sore from the past few practices.When we nourish ourselves, we can better serve others.
